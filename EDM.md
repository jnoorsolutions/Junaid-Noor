---

### 🔹 5. Tool Governance & MCP Integration

- Tool assignment per section
- Role-based tool validation
- Tool bypass rules (case-insensitive enforcement)
- Rate limit per tool
- External tool orchestration (DB / MCP / App tools)
- Multi-agent tool execution pipeline

Planner → ToolService → Composer architecture

---

### 🔹 6. Agentic AI Architecture

- Single-Agent orchestration
- Multi-Agent orchestration
- Deterministic tool sequencing
- RAG fallback mode
- Tool error handling
- Controlled tool injection

---

### 🔹 7. Secure Document & Vector Management
